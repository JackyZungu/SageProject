     <p>Description: My work philosophy was to strive for the best in the interest of SAGE LIBRARY PROJECT. I had to adapt very fast, as I am always looking forward to learn. I had dealt with challenges and responsibilities in the best manner, this has made me realise my capabilities. I have actually realised that I am a strong communicator and that team work needs patience. I am a person who understood how vital my performance within the role is to have a success in this amazing project we have done. I performed all my duties to an exemplary standard to quickly become a team member who contributes positively to this project. The development of this project was merely a coding exercise but a transformative journey, there was an enthusiasm equipped with a good perspective on software development. This made me realise that nothing is more amazing that exploring a library. We may have encountered challenges but that was an opportunity to enhance my problem solving skills and testing my mind-set to overcome any obstacle as a stepping stone to success. This project of creating a library has taught me the importance of adaptability and evolving into technology. As I reflect on this opportunity, it has been an amazing journey and I am looking forward to work on projects like this in future again. I have developed enthusiasm under software development and it has expanded my knowledge towards devOps. I have learned the art of collaboration, sharing my own view and adapting to different views from others. I was under the CSS group and our duty was to apply the best style an ensure that the project was presentable and I had to work seamlessly to ensure that everything is in order, not only did I work under CSS group but I was the presenter who showcased our amazing work that we did willingly and out of love. This was one of the best achievements in my life. </p>
